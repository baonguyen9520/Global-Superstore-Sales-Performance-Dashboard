# Global-Superstore-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
Created a Power BI dashboard analyzing global Superstore sales across regions and product categories. Highlighted top-performing markets (LATAM, Technology) and areas needing improvement (EMEA, Furniture, US returns) to guide data-driven business decisions.
1) Business Objective

The Senior Manager wanted insights into three main areas:
Overall company performance
Market performance across regions
Product category performance
To address these questions, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize sales, profit, and return trends, providing clear guidance for decision-making.

2) Dataset Details

The dataset includes three main tables:
Orders: Sales transaction details (Order Date, Product, Sales, Profit ...)
People: Information about regional sales representatives
Returns: List of returned transactions

3) Dashboard Features

Business Overview: High-level summary of global sales, revenue, and profit trends
Market Performance: Detailed analysis by region, highlighting profitable and underperforming markets
Category Performance: Insights into product categories, growth trends, and losses
Sales Agents Performance: Evaluation of individual sales reps and regional teams
Insights & Recommendations: Personalized findings and strategic suggestions for business growth

4) Key Insights

Business Performance by Market
Strongest Market: LATAM – $2.64B net revenue, stable profitability
Weakest Markets: EMEA (–$86.50M) and Africa (–$56.98M) → unprofitable, need further investigation
Returns Impact: Lowest in APAC (0.21%), highest in the US (14.92%)
Highlight: The US market shows high net profit ($1.63B) but also a high return rate, posing potential risk to overall profitability

Business Performance by Product Category
Strongest Category: Technology – $3.65B net revenue, positive growth trend
Weakest Category: Furniture – –$184.39M net revenue, loss-making, may require strategic changes or elimination
Returns Impact: Highest in Office Supplies (1.42%), lowest in Furniture (0.03%), though Furniture remains unprofitable due to low sales and margins

5) Tools & Skills

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX calculations, dashboard design
Excel / Google Sheets: Data cleaning and initial analysis
Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards for insights

6) Results

The dashboard provides senior management a clear view of the company’s global performance, helping them:
